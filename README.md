# Cryptoccurency Quantitative Strategy Project
This repository contains the full pipeline for a quantitative research project focused on Bitcoin (BTC) trading strategy development. The project was conducted for learning and researching initiative and includes data engineering, feature extraction, predictive modeling, and backtested trading strategy design.

# Project Overview
We develop a systematic approach to forecast Bitcoin market behavior using historical OHLCV data and time-series features. The project leverages Python-based tools for data processing, machine learning model training, and strategy evaluation.
## Core components include / planned:
• Real-time and historical data collection (Planned)
• Data cleaning and transformation
• Feature engineering
• Regression and classification (Planned) modeling using PyCaret
• Strategy development and backtesting (Planned)
• ArcticDB for efficient time-series storage
